- GCN: AUC=0.7839, F1=0.2784
- GAT: AUC=0.7872, F1=0.3158

Traditional ML Models Performance:
- Gradient Boosting: AUC=0.9625, F1=0.7568
- Logistic Regression: AUC=0.9750, F1=0.5064
- Random Forest: AUC=0.9036, F1=0.6800
- SVM: AUC=0.9046, F1=0.5283

Key Findings:
1. Traditional ML models generally outperform GNNs on this specific dataset
2. Gradient Boosting achieved the highest F1-score (0.7568)
3. Logistic Regression achieved the highest AUC (0.9750)
4. GraphSAGE was the best performing GNN model
5. The graph structure provides additional context but feature engineering is critical
